# Vampire-Voice-Assistant---Beta
A voice assistant being developed in Python, very basic as of now, but development is in progress.
HOW TO USE:

Download the .zip file, and extract the folder.
Scroll until you find Vampire.exe, and run as administrator.
Say "Vampire" to wake the assistant!
If there are any bugs, they will be fixed in the next update.
Finally, remember, this is a beta, meaning that not everything will work as expected, and there will be bugs.
Expect release 1.0 in around August 2023!
